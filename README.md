# React Project for Sprint

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

The fastest way to start coding is to use GitHub Codespaces:

1. Click the "Code" button above
2. Select the "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"

This will open a fully configured development environment in your browser with all dependencies installed and ready to go!

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
